## **Background & Introduction**
First responder vehicles can experience delays enroute to emergencies due to adverse traffic conditions. Road practices in Singapore involve motorists keeping to the slower lanes as far as possible, and filtering to the left upon hearing an emergency  vehicle siren. However, this process is often slowed down due to congestion during peak hours. This may prove to be an obstacle for emergency vehicles attending to time-critical missions, and may result in serious complications or loss of lives during emergencies. 
For example, from a discussion with a firefighter, he shared that he often had to run red lights or use a loud hailer to clear a path for his vehicle while enroute. Despite having a siren and lights , civilian vehicles need to be close enough to see an emergency vehicle before they can start moving. 

As such, we asked ourselves: **how might we provide earlier warning to drivers, so that they have more time to stop or clear a path for an emergency vehicle?**

## **The Solution**
Currently, a GPS route is automatically set to guide an emergency vehicle to its objective. An opportunity might arise when Singapore releases its **new in-vehicle unit** which has connectivity features that could be used to **reduce the time needed to attend to emergencies.** 

We devised a solution that would eventually be able to harness the **GPS capabilities** in these smart in-vehicle units to alert drivers of approaching emergency vehicles in real-time. When a route is set on the GPS of the emergency vehicle, motorists in the proximity (within 200m) of the vehicles would get an **alert on the IU** to move to a particular lane, depending on the movement of the emergency vehicle. This would clear the path for emergency services ahead of time and provide motorists with **more time to safely filter out of the emergency lane**.

This is effectively an **IoT solution** utilizing the capabilities of connected devices. Upon selecting an emergency route, data from IUs currently present on the route can be **collected on IBM cloud, and filtered in real-time**. Vehicles in a 200m proximity would then be notified about the incoming emergency vehicle through their IUs.
