## **Background & Introduction**
First responder vehicles can experience delays enroute to emergencies due to adverse traffic conditions. Road practices in Singapore involve motorists keeping to the slower lanes as far as possible, and filtering to the left upon hearing an emergency  vehicle siren. However, this process is often slowed down due to congestion during peak hours. This may prove to be an obstacle for emergency vehicles attending to time-critical missions, and may result in serious complications or loss of lives during emergencies. //develop further
For example, from a discussion with a firefighter, he shared that he often had to run red lights or use a loud hailer to clear a path for his vehicle while enroute. Despite having a siren and lights , civilian vehicles need to be close enough to see an emergency vehicle before they can start moving.
